# nvim_config


## NOTES:

- If using terminal in windows, remap Ctrl+v to Crtrl+Shift+v.
  - This will allow using Ctrl-v in nvim (visual block mode), but suprisingly -\_('-')_/- and magically XD this does not overwrite the remap. i.e. even after the remap Ctrl-v works for paste but wont work when nvim is active.

- Require node for pyright. Used nvm for isntalling node, migth as well do it that way.

- Install Glow using chcocolatey (visit: https://github.com/ellisonleao/glow.nvim)

## Oh My Posh

- "catppuccin_custom.omp.json" is the custom json used for oh-my-posh, use this when importing the config

-  Use this command to disable terminal's default venv 
   - >$env:VIRTUAL_ENV_DISABLE_PROMPT = 1
