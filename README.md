# nvim_config


## NOTES:

- If using terminal in windows, remap Ctrl+v to Crtrl+Shift+v.
  - This will allow using Ctrl-v in nvim (visual block mode), but suprisingly -\_('-')_/- and magically XD this does not overwrite the remap. i.e. evern after the remat Ctrl-v works for past but wont work when nvim is active.
- Require node for pyright. Used nvm for isntalling node, migth as well do it that way.
- Install Glow using chcocolatey (visit: https://github.com/ellisonleao/glow.nvim)
